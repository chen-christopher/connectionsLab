        <p>
          Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a
          cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly
          its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large
          with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its
          lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a
          circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand.
          Snorlax's bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type. <br />
          <br />
          Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to
          eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to
          its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it
          to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even
          handle thorny plants or Muk's poison. It can also eat while it is
          resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon
          bounce on its large stomach. <br />
