# Assignment 1


### Project Description

For this assignment, I wanted to make a simple web page for my favorite pokemon Snorlax. There wasn't anything too complex I wanted to incoporate and I divided the web page into four sections: landing page, description, a video, and fan art. The link to the web page is listed below:

### Process

The landing page is an image centered using flexbox. For my projects, I like to create blocks that are 100% in width and 100vh so that it encapusalates the entire screen. I use a general flexbox class that centers the image. The following pages all follow a similar format. The description section utilizes the same flex classes but has the flex direction to column so that the header text is above the image and paragraph. The image and paragraph is then put into another flexbox with flex direction set to row. The video section utilizes the same column flexbox with the items centered. Lastly, the fan art section follows the description section with a full screen flexbox with flex direction column and the images in a flex direction row div. The wireframe of this assignment is attached below: 

### Reflection

Although I've made multiple web pages before, I've still learned a great deal with this assignment. For this assignment, I tried to follow the naming conventions that we discussed in class. In my previous projects, I just name my components with what I think the component should be. For example, I would name the home page with the class name homePage and the following elements would be like homePageDiv. Although there is some information that can be obtained from the class name, it isn't the clearest to other people if they were to look at my code. Additionally, my naming isn't always consistent and I've tried to be more careful while naming my classes for this assignment. Another thing that I learned was using more accurate tags instead of just the div tag. Previously, for sections, I would just use the div tag for everything. I've tried to be a bit more accurate with my HTML and I've clearly divided the sections of this assignment using the section tag.
